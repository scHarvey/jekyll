  description: Our team at Catchfire Media built an iOS app for a national fraternity. We were involved from the beginning with early concepts of possible features and continued through the entire product lifecycle. I helped steer features and then the look and feel of the app and then built a WordPress based CMS to allow new content to be sent to the app. Additionally we leveraged the Parse.com API for user management, in app chat, a photo feed with user controlled content, and push notifications. I built apps into the WordPress system to allow SAE to upload their own images to the stream (like instagram) and to also compose push notifications without mucking around in the Parse.com back end.

  description: In addition to help developing the look and feel for the app I was tasked with creating a CMS with an API to allow the client to create and edit content easily and have it seamlessly feed in to both an iPhone and an Android application. Leveraging the power of WordPress I created custom post types for each content type and then created a custom template that creates an XML feed in the format expected by both apps. In addition to being able to request all the data in each particular feed you're able to send a 'last update date' parameter and only get items that have changed since you last called home. We also use this system to create a Foursquare like checkin service that allows users to announce to other app users that they're at a particular location and then see other users at that location. We also hook in to the Facebook API to highlight the user's friends that are checked in.

  description: Creation of a WordPress based site that is the back end for an in store experiential photo booth powered by an augmented reality iPad app that I oversaw the development of. The WordPress site allows the app to submit new photos as custom posts and creates an Instagram like experience for the users, creating a single image page with social sharing buttons and a personalized message. Two minutes after the photo is submitted an email is sent to the user with a shortened URL to their photo. Another web service was created to allow the iPad to pull down a slideshow of recent images to act as an in store attractor loop.Since the launch of the photo booth in a single store it has averaged over 1000 photos a week, and we are currently working to roll it out in to 2 other stores, with more to follow in the coming months.
