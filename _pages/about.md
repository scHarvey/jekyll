Welcome to my corner of the web. My name is Clint Harvey. I credit a very independent childhood with instilling in me the love for problem solving and computers that I later turned into an ability to take complex real world problems and turn them into repeatable processes in code. I have [too many dogs](http://packlove.com/human/clint). I enjoy [taking photographs](http://500px.clintharvey.net "photography") during my much too frequent trips to the dog park. On this site you'll find my photos, profiles of my projects, and my general musings on things I'm interested in. Feel free to [contact me](http://www.twitter.com/scharvey "contact") if you have a project you think I'd be interested in, or for any reason.
