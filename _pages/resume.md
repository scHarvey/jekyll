#### Introduction
With over 15 years of experience doing everything from database design to web application development to my current position as Lead Developer, I have developed, and continue to expand, a broad array of skills that I feel make me a value to any company. I'm a highly talented and well rounded individual with a proven ability to meet and beat deadlines, the ability to transform abstract ideas into real world applications, and to the vision to see how to streamline troublesome processes. My goal is to be a guru for using technology to make lives easier, be it on the web or mobile applications, and to help mentor other developers.
