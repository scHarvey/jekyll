Had a very strange dream last night that I was paddling a kayak in tranquil waters and then, without warning, the water sped up and started getting turgid, tossing me around. I was unable to control the kayak, or escape the foaming torrent, when suddenly the water just dropped out beneath me and I was thrown from the boat as we fell hundreds of feet to the bottom of the waterfall. I can't remember if I ever surfaced. [I love you, but goodbye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQX4tl-Xps "I love you, but goodbye")
